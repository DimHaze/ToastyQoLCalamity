# ImogenQoLCalamity

An addon mod for ImogenQoL that adds Calamity features to the mod. This uses a strong reference, however this is not required and is used for convinience as this mod does nothing without the main QoL mod.

## UI:

- Adds several Calamity specific toggles.
- Adds an Automatic Progression System to allow automatic use of permanent power up items upon reaching their tier (Such as the Blood Orange).
- Adds MNLs for Revengeance, Death, Infernum and an option to use Calamity Tester Killtimes instead.

## Items:

- Adds Shiny Wand, an item that lets you spawn a simulation of Calamitas' bullet hells to practice.
- Adds Reflective Wand, an item that lets you spawn a simulation of every SCal bullet hell to practice.
- Adds more boss spawners for Calamity bosses.
- Adds "Potion of Rage", a potion that gives you max rage for 2 seconds if no boss is alive.
